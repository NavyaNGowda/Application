                    <p>
                        <h3>What does self-acceptance have to do with it?</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It makes sense that self-esteem stems from self-acceptance. This means that you need to accept
                                who you are and not who you think you're supposed to be. This also means that you need to
                                accept your good qualities and your bad ones. And yes, everyone has both good and bad qualities.</li>
                            <li> Self-acceptance is the ability to accept yourself as you are instead of how you wish you were,
                                or how you wish others perceived you. It frees you from an overly high concern with what
                                other people think about you.</li>
                            <li> Self-acceptance is the feeling of satisfaction with yourself despite your weaknesses and regardless
                                of your past behaviors and choices. It’s necessary for good mental health. </li>
                        </ul>

                                <p>It's time to accept the fact that no one judges you more than you judge yourself. You can
                                    be your own worst enemy,but you need to get out of your way, and start developing patience.Be
                                    patient with yourself. People who will talk about you do so because they’re unhealthy.
                                    It’s their deal and not yours. Healthy people will not talk about you. They’ll only cheer
                                    you on.

                                <p>Far too many people don’t love themselves, and they claim to love others. You can’t love others until you really love yourself, 
                                        because to love yourself is to be healthy. There is some emerging advice that you can love others even if you don’t love yourself.
                                        It’s a recipe for disaster. If you don’t love yourself, you’re not going to truly love others, which means you won’t respect them. 
                                        Loving yourself is about nurturing yourself, self-care and an attitude that shows you care about your well-being.

                                <p>You are capable of accomplishing great things. Believe that you can do anything because you can. You are a strong and powerful being, and you can deal with any challenge that comes your way. 
                                        Remember, you've already survived the worst thing you've experienced in your life.

                            <li> <h5>CONFRONT YOUR FEARS</h5>
                                <p>We all have a history that includes some bad, devastating thing. 
                                        We all have baggage to go with that bad history. We're human, and we're bound to be hurt by something. 
                                        But it's the fear of the unknown that keeps us trapped. 
                                        We're so afraid to experience something unfamiliar that we allow ourselves to become stuck in what we know. 
                                        It's important to take baby steps to create change. Start by making a list about things that scare you. Start with one small thing, try to face it,
                                        and understand why it's not so scary.Then move onto the next small thing, and so on.

                                            Creating the life you want and the goals you want to achieve helps you to be happy and appreciate yourself for your unique qualities. 
                                            Going against the flow is stressful. Doing what you love promotes happiness.

                                                Figure out what motivates you by celebrating something you are bad at. It's in these intimate moments that life's precious lessons are learned.
